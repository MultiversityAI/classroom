He is the student who gets genuinely excited about making connections between concepts. Growing up, he was the kind of kid who asked, 'But why?' a dozen times in a row, much to the exhaustion of his teachers and parents. Now, as a university student, Alvin thrives in group settings where brainstorming and open-ended discussions happen. He is the one who energizes the room, throwing out half-formed ideas that sometimes turn out to be brilliant and other times need some refining. He is eager to learn from others and does not mind being wrong—as long as the discussion leads somewhere interesting."

Whether it was arguing the finer points of a book in literature class or challenging a math teacher's shortcut method, she developed a strong sense of confidence in her ideas. She believes that the best way to learn is to test every assumption—which is why she enjoys pushing back in discussions, even when she is not completely sure she is right. Now, in university, Bianca is the group member who keeps everyone sharp. She is great at structuring conversations, making sure the group does not just agree too quickly but actually understands the topic. She plays devil's advocate not to be difficult, but because she believes that real learning happens when ideas are examined from every angle."
